				<h1> The Way I See It...</h1>
				<p>There is a way to all things which we desire. Learning to code is no different. 
				I started with computing early in my life. I was 11 years old when I got my first computer.
				My mom was in the service Army. I was an army brat. She sent home a Tandy 1000. Most of you are probably thinking
				"What is a Tandy??" well I still can't explain it. But to make a long story short it was WORK. I had to write
				long line of code to get the screen to display one little pattern. It was tedious back then. It's an understatement to 
				say that I quit the coding business all together and decided to study Accounting instead. </p>
				<p>
				But here I am again. Where there lies passion, it will never rest until the desire is fullfilled. I love coding; Good. Bad. Or Indifferent. We will all be great at something one day. We might as well put that time into something we actually like.  
				</p>

			 	<h1> What Is This Site All About?</h1>
				<p> I started this site as a way to share technical information for prospective delevopers, coders, and anyone else interested. I will post a variety of things but mainly coding videos and related articles that I have researched and written.<p/>

				<p> I am going to expand the site so please feel free to send me suggestions and requests. I would love to hear from you. In the meantime, <b>stay tuned</b>. I will be putting up my first content in the next week. </p>
				<p>
				Thank you all for visiting. Happy Surfing~ &#9786; &#9787;</p>
