   <h1> Welcome</h1>
   <br>
	<p>Something exciting... an experience that you always want to share.
	Imagine doing something you love, it helps people, it can make the world a better place and it pays you! 
	<!insert happy emoticon here-->
	<br>That's a career.</p>

	<p> We all have dream which is often relative to our culture or way we grew up. My
	dream consist of helping other females become more of who they can be; helping them
	reach their full potential in the job market. Help them think like entrepenuers not simply employees.</p>

	<p> My plan is to develop a program to train under-privileged
	girls become more than where they are, or who they have been told
	they are or what others think they should be. The girls who are abused and
	neglected, the girls that grow up in poverty, those that struggle with simple
	every day things due to lack of resources such as books, money, transportation,utilities. I want to travel to different cities and provide online programs to many through their schools,churches, or similar organizations.</p>

	<p>Someone always says "knowledge is power", but I believe Power is Power.
	The knowledge just helps you take the power in the right direction. Girls need
	to gain the knowledge so they know how to tap into their power and focus it to
	take them where they want to go in life. There is hope: <b>The Code.</b>
